## User Interface Classes

### Generic UI

<ClassComponent
  className="src.ui.ui.UI"

    The UI class is an abstract base class for user interface components. This class outlines a framework for displaying information and facilitating interaction with users across various stages of the toolkit's execution, including dataset creation, finetuning, inference, and quality assurance testing.

    This component is designed to be subclassed, with specific implementations providing concrete methods for all interactions required by the toolkit. These interactions could range from input collection for dataset specifications to displaying finetuning progress, presenting inference results, and summarizing quality assurance test outcomes.
