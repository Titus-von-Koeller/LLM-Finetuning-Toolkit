# General Structure

The configuration file has a hierarchical structure with the following main sections:

- `save_dir`: The directory where the experiment results will be saved.
- `ablation`: Settings for ablation studies.
- `data`: Configuration for data ingestion.
- `model`: Model definition and settings.
- `lora`: Configuration for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
- `training`: Settings for the training process.
- `inference`: Configuration for the inference stage.

Each section contains subsections and parameters that fine-tune the behavior of the toolkit. Let's dive into each section in more detail.
